# 🖥️ Virtual Machine Lab Environment

## 📚 Overview
This project is a self-hosted virtual lab for practicing cybersecurity, network simulation, and system administration. It includes multiple VMs simulating a real-world IT environment.

## 🧱 Lab Architecture
- **VMs Used:**
  - Windows Server 2019 – Active Directory, DNS
  - Ubuntu 22.04 – Web server (Apache/Nginx)
  - Kali Linux – Penetration testing tools
  - pfSense – Firewall/router

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- VirtualBox / VMware
- Kali Linux, Metasploit, Nmap, Wireshark
- PowerShell, Bash, SSH
- Network segmentation, NAT, Port forwarding

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Install VirtualBox / VMware.
2. Download and import VM images (or create from ISOs).
3. Configure internal networks and shared folders.
4. Setup AD/DNS on Windows Server.
5. Test connectivity across machines.

## 📖 Use Cases / Scenarios
